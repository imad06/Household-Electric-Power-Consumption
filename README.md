4.globalreactivepower: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.submetering1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.submetering2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
